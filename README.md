# Library-management

The project is aimed to create an app to aid library management, which includes functions like: searching, recording the actions of readers and admin's actions such as adding new books.

I worked with Binlei Li(李斌磊） on this project. As far as I remember, he worked on function of statistic and help. 

Sadly, the code was writted years ago and most of the comments are in Chinese.
